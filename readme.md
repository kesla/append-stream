A quick and dirty really fast stream-like module to append data to a file

## Installation

```
npm install append-stream
```

## Differences from fs.WriteStream

`append-stream` behaves similar to `fs.createWriteStream()` - but it has fewer features. Currently `append-stream` does not support:

* .pipe()
* backpressure
* streams2-compability

In `append-stream` a write() you can only handle errors in the callback. This means that the below example there's no way to handle any potential error.

```javascript

var stream = new AppendStream(filename)

stream.write('beep')
stream.write('boop')

```

## Example

### Input

```javascript
var filename = __dirname + '/testdir/beep-boop'
  , AppendStream = require('./append-stream')

  , stream = new AppendStream(filename)

stream.write('beep')
stream.write('boop', function () {
  require('fs').readFile(filename, 'utf8', function (err, content) {
    console.log('written to file:')
    console.log(content)
  })
})
```

### Output

```
written to file:
beepboop
```

## Benchmark

Running `node benchmark.js` on my Macbook Pro I see:

```
AppendStream: 15ms
WriteStream: 74ms
```
