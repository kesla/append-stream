# append-stream[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kesla/append-stream.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/kesla/append-stream)

__sales pitch__: Sometimes all you want to do is to write to a file. And you want it to be simple. And fast. Oh, and perhaps open the file lazily. Well, than `append-stream` is the right choice for you!

## Installation

```
npm install append-stream
```

## Features

### Comparsion to fs.createWriteStream()

`append-stream` behaves similar to `fs.createWriteStream()` - but it has fewer features. Currently `append-stream` does not support:

* .pipe()
* backpressure
* streams2-compability
* writing data at some point past the beginning of the file
* events

### Buffering

When a stream isn't avaible for write (e.g. when a write is active or the stream is getting opened), all subsequental writes will be buffered and then written to disk in a single write once the stream is available again. This explains the super fast times for writing concurrently, as shown in the benchmarks below.

### Error handling

In `append-stream` a write() or end() you can only handle errors in the callback. This means that the below example there's no way to handle any potential error.

```javascript

var stream = new AppendStream(filename)

stream.write('beep')
stream.write('boop')
stream.end()

```

### lazy: true

A feature that `append-stream` has is that you can configure it to lazily open (and thereby create) the file that's being appended to.

This means that the file will be opened the first time that you call `stream.write()`

## Example

### Input

```javascript
var directory = __dirname + '/testdir/'
  , filename = directory + 'beep-boop'
  , AppendStream = require('./append-stream')

  , stream

require('rimraf').sync(directory)
require('mkdirp').sync(directory)

stream = new AppendStream(filename)

stream.write('beep')
stream.write('boop', function () {
  require('fs').readFile(filename, 'utf8', function (err, content) {
    console.log('written to file:')
    console.log(content)

    // you can also use append-stream as a factory
    require('./append-stream')(filename + '2', function (err, stream) {
      console.log('the stream is now opened and ready!')
      // nice - you can end a stream!
      stream.end(function () {
        console.log('and now the stream has ended')
        // lazy: true means that the file won't be opened (created) unless there's a write
        require('./append-stream')(filename + '3', { lazy: true }, function (err, stream) {
          stream.end(function () {
            require('fs').exists(filename + '3', function (exists) {
              console.log('Does this file exists (it should not)?', exists)
            })
          })
        })
      })
    })
  })
})
```

### Output

```
written to file:
beepboop
the stream is now opened and ready!
and now the stream has ended
Does this file exists (it should not)? false
```

## Benchmark

Running `node benchmark.js` on my Macbook Air (mid 2012) I get the following results:

```
writing 100000 small Buffers in parallel
AppendStream: 310ms
WriteStream: 6836ms
writing 100000 small Buffers in series
AppendStream: 1815ms
WriteStream: 2066ms
```
